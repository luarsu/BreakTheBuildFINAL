About our project:
The Devil Is In The Details

The devil is in the details is a first person horror-puzzle game inspired by some childhood nightmares of the team that developed it. In the game, we play as a child trapped in a nightmarish maze that has to solve the challenges in it to collect and bring three gnome statues to their corresponding place in order to enter the warm and safe manor in the middle of the maze. However, this task will be harder than it seems, as we will be constantly chased by the Bill the Tar Man, a man eater ghoul that lives in the maze and doesn’t like intruders. The Maze is full of secrets, and in order to distinguish what’s real from what’s not, you will have to use the magic glasses. With them, you will be able to solve all the riddles in the maze and wake up before Bill catches you.
