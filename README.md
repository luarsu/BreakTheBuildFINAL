About our project:
The Devil Is In The Details

The devil is in the details is a first person horror-puzzle game inspired by some childhood nightmares of the team that developed it. In the game, we play as a child trapped in a nightmarish maze that has to solve the challenges in it to collect and bring three gnome statues to their corresponding place in order to enter the warm and safe manor in the middle of the maze. However, this task will be harder than it seems, as we will be constantly chased by the Bill the Tar Man, a man eater ghoul that lives in the maze and doesn’t like intruders. The Maze is full of secrets, and in order to distinguish what’s real from what’s not, you will have to use the magic glasses. With them, you will be able to solve all the riddles in the maze and wake up before Bill catches you.

# How to download the project and edit it in Unreal
Pre-requirements:

-Unreal (4.14.0 version)
-GitHub Desktop app

# Initial steps (only needed one time):

In the GitHub project's website, click the green button to the right named Clone or Download.
Then, click the option to Open in Desktop. This will open the GitHub Desktop app and prompt you to select where in your computer to save the project.
Wait until the project is downloaded (it will probably take a lot of time if there are big asset files).

# Working steps:

- At the top of the GitHub Desktop app, left to the Commited Changes tab (at first it will probably say 'No uncommited changes'), there is the branch dropdown (at first it will say 'master'). You can change the branch you are working on here. NEVER WORK ON MASTER!
- To create a branch, click the button to the left of the branch dropdown. Try to name your branch something significant, like the name of the feature you are going to work on.
- Once you are in your branch, open the folder in your computer that contains the project.
- Right click on the BreakTheBuildFINAL.uproject file, and select Open with > Unreal Editor (4.14.10).
- Explore the project and make as many changes as you want!
